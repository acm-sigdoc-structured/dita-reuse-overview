# dita-reuse-overview
*Sample DITA source files in support of ACM-013 ("How does DITA 1.3 Support Content Reuse?")*

To test basic examples of DITA reuse using library topics and direct (URL-based) references, open ``map_reuse.ditamap`` in your DITA editor.

To test that same library with indirect (key-based) references, open ``map_reuse_with-keys.ditamap`` in your DITA editor.
